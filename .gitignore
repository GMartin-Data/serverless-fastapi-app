#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to PDMPEP 582 recommendation, it's better to not include Pipfile.lock
#   in non-application projects. They generally belong to projects that are intended
#   to be deployed, not published to PyPI. PDM also chooses not to include them.
#   Additionally, Pipfile.lock tends to be noisy and sometimes causes merge conflicts
#   when collaborating. Pipfile.lock records the exact hashes of the packages into
#   the lock file. This ensures reproducible builds across different environments.
#   However, for libraries, it's generally not recommended to include it.
